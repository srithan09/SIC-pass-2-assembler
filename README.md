# SIC-pass-2-assembler

Pass 2 of an assembler is responsible for generating the final machine code or object code based on the intermediate code produced by Pass 1. The primary tasks of Pass 2 include resolving addresses, generating code for instructions, and creating the final object code file.

Here's a general overview of how Pass 2 works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Open necessary files, including the intermediate file produced by Pass 1.

2. **Read Header Record:**
   - Read the header record from the intermediate file, which contains information about the program name, starting address, and program length.

3. **Generate Header Record in Object Code:**
   - Write the header record to the object code file. The header record typically includes information like program name, starting address, and program length.

4. **Read Text Records:**
   - Read each text record from the intermediate file. Text records contain the actual machine instructions or data.

5. **Generate Text Record in Object Code:**
   - Translate each instruction or data item from the text record into machine code and write the corresponding text record to the object code file.

6. **Read End Record:**
   - Read the end record from the intermediate file, which contains the program's starting address.

7. **Generate End Record in Object Code:**
   - Write the end record to the object code file. The end record typically includes the program's starting address.

8. **Close Files:**
   - Close all open files.

The Pass 2 process involves interpreting the intermediate code produced by Pass 1, generating machine code, and producing the final executable or object code file. It requires knowledge of the instruction set architecture, addressing modes, and other details of the target machine.

In the provided assembler code, Pass 2 seems to include the following steps:

- **Reading Intermediate File:**
  - The code opens the intermediate file and reads various records, including the header, text, and end records.

- **Generating Object Code:**
  - The code processes each instruction or data item from the text records and translates them into machine code. It then writes the corresponding text records to the object code file.

- **Handling End Record:**
  - The code generates the end record in the object code file, indicating the starting address of the program.

- **Closing Files:**
  - Finally, the code closes all open files.

The specific details of Pass 2 depend on the architecture of the target machine and the features of the assembly language being processed. Pass 2 essentially involves converting the symbolic representation of instructions and data into the binary machine code that can be executed by the computer's hardware.
